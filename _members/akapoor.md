I am an undergraduate student majoring in Biomedical Science with a Spanish minor. I am from Upper Arlington, Ohio and joined the Englert lab in 2024. My focus in the lab is studying the difference in ventilator induced lung injury in cancer and non-cancer mice. Outside of the lab, I enjoy spending time with my family, baking, and being outdoors.
